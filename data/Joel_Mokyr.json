This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India. China had [[movable type]], and India had similar levels of scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an \"integrated market for ideas\" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of [[Latin]], had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy |isbn=9780691180960 |access-date=9 March 2017|last1=Mokyr |first1=Joel |year=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty diff-side-added\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\" data-marker=\"\u2212\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline diff-side-deleted\"><br /></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty diff-side-added\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\"><a class=\"mw-diff-movedpara-left\" title=\"Paragraph was moved.
